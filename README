Components of the WTSI genotype analysis pipeline.

This pipeline is designed to process large volumes of raw genotyping
data into genotype calls. The platform supported is Illumina Infinium
genotyping microarrays, supplemented with Sequenom genotyping.

The gender check used as a QC metric is also available as a standalone
application; see below.

Requirements:


Pipeline:

 Ruby 1.8.7
 Percolate              https://github.com/wtsi-npg/Percolate


QC scripts:

 R >= 2.11.1
 R mixtools library	 http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/index.html


Pipeline metadata management:

 Perl >= v5.8.8 
 DBIx::Class            http://search.cpan.org/~arodland/DBIx-Class/
 SQLite                 http://sqlite.org/


Pipeline components:

 Illuminus              https://github.com/wtsi-npg/Illuminus
 Gftools                https://github.com/wtsi-npg/Gftools
 genotype-call          https://github.com/wtsi-npg/genotype-call


Environment variables:

 PATH       Should include path to <install_dir>/bin
 PERL5LIB   Should include path to <install_dir>/src/perl/lib/
 R_LIBS     Should include path to mixtools library installation



### Gendermix: standalone gender check ###

The 'gendermix' gender check method can be installed as a standalone 
application.  This is done using the appropriate target for the Perl build 
script; see src/perl/README for details.  Gendermix trains a Gaussian 
mixture model in order to find adaptive thresholds for X chromosome 
heterozygosity, used to infer whether a sample is male or female.

The standalone check omits much of the pipeline code.  Requirements
which do not apply to the standalone check include Ruby, Percolate, Illuminus, 
and Gftools; all other requirements are still in effect.
