To run workflow tests, the following steps must be performed:

Installation:

1) The Perl libraries in this repository must be installed and the Perl and R
   scripts must be available on the PATH.

2) The genotype callers Illuminus and GenoSNP must be available on the PATH.

3) The Gftools library must be installed (required by Illuminus and GenoSNP).

4) The format-shifting utility program genotype-call must be available on the
   PATH.

5) The plinktools package (version >= 0.4.1) must be available on the PATH.

Test data acquisition:

5) A pipeline runtime database named 'genotyping.db' must be created using the
   Perl scripts ready_pipe.pl, ready_infinium.pl and/or ready_external.pl. This
   file must be copied to the test directory.

   This file cannot be distributed for reasons of data confidentiality.

6) Expected Plink output from the genotype callers Illuminus, GenoSNP and 
   ZCall with input from the genotyping.db described in step 5 must be placed 
   in an "external data" directory.

   These files cannot be distributed for reasons of confidentiality.

7) A .bpm.csv SNP manifest and .egt cluster file, corresponding to the given 
   genotyping.db described in step 5, must be placed in the external data 
   directory described in step 6.

Shell environment setup:

8) The environment variable GENOTYPE_TEST_DATA must be set to the absolute path
   of the external data directory described in step 6 6.
