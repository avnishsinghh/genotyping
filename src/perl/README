Components of the WTSI genotype analysis pipeline.

This is the perl Genotyping module, a component of the WTSI genotype
analysis pipeline which provides command-line applications. These
applications may be run manually or within a pipeline defined by the
Ruby Genotyping module.

This software uses Module::Build to build, test and install its Perl
packages.  In addition, the install_R target will install the
required R scripts.

To install:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build test
  ./Build install --install_base <target directory>
  ./Build install_config --install_base <target directory>
  ./Build install_R --install_base <target directory>


### Gendermix: standalone gender check ###

The 'gendermix' gender check method can be installed as a standalone 
application.  The install_gendermix target will install all required Perl, R, 
and config files.  Note that install_gendermix has its own version of the 
Genotyping.pm Perl module, which appears in the source as 
lib/WTSI/GenotypingReduced and replaces the standard Genotyping.pm in the 
install_gendermix build.

To install:

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build test --test_files t/gender_standalone.t
 ./Build install_gendermix --install_base <target directory>
